P.O.P.


Twentyfive whores in the room next door
»twentyfive, whores« wheeping next room 

Twenty five floors and I need more
twenty five, rose brand flour, and i need more 

I am looking for a can in a candy store
I would be looking like the man of a hairem store

2000 and before. In colors I hadn't seen before
He is still not looking like the man in that hairem store ...

Well, well.
They are guessing each other's food and soap and no one is browsing *con gas* 

It's a small world and it smells funny.
It was a staged stage and he would not trap any rat


I'd buy another if it wasn't for the money.
You do not want to write me so to play not, if it was about the so-called trash


Take back! What I paid! 
Like she listen over him write and he would have to play romance to me or to my testimony ?!


For another motherfucker in a motor cape!
For another Wood-Stock-Family in a Broad-Cast-House 


In a long black car,
for an offer-demand balancing mobilé price


with the prettiest sheat from panama,
with the duty-free-jews without raffinery,


when the sirens wheel and the lights smash blue,
when 0 pegs (kegs?) float and blacks burn the oil,  


my vision-thing come slamming through

There is a spy in Ingo's brother !

Brother Ingo is lock-picking the door of a spy in his home !

And Ingo Ingo is to be the Electri-City !

Ingo Graf Schneider is a new council at the Betreuungsgericht !



Small world and it smells bad!
Skinny miss doctor Cicha and a complaint too wide-spreading for miss judge with corona-mask !


I'd buy another if i had
Under this kind of reports escorting I,Ingo would be looking for some protective-gear, my brother is mentally ill !


back what i paid
Frau Doctor Cicha on the side was jumping from her seat and besieging miss judge (October 2020, Linprunstraße, police in the room about her don't care)


Small world and it smells bad
European Marriage, and they are hosting one single bride


I'd buy another if i had
I'd answer myself, if they'd buy such car

Take back! What I paid! 
my bavarian roggy peasant brad lockpicking his own cellar-menúe ! 

For another motherfucker in a motor cape!
i am a fag in a collision car taking the sax through the open doors !

What - ever - do we need to make out
What ever Bohland needed to advertise

will come alive.
will come alive !

What does it take to make us sing.
What did it take Hitler to make you arie like for some Jew ?

What - while - are we waiting for the next one to arrive.
How many play-offs are we waiting for the next Jackson to cop out for Black Power !

One billion points of light.
One billion vetos from the cannonfodder-punk himself !  

One billion dollar.
One billion nickels !

Vision thing!
Holy roman empire german national !

Another black hole in the killing zone.
Another holism in the recording zone !

A little more mad in the method drome.
Some more dramatis personae on the readers' side !


One blinding flash of sense.
One blinded choice from several wrong


Just like the presidents.
just like the dollar on cheese on the Sinai


There isn't much evidence.
Just like the german-roman-legionairies forcing everyone in South-Africa to bread and wine back in the 19. century  !


Out of mind outa my mind.
Punk's not dead, Punk's not colone !


Blizzard thing.
The Marcel Pin of the world had himself crossed the threshold of the kitchen sink and the microfone-membrane had overturned the order of the solos !


Bring it on home.
Romans is punk, too !


Shal-a-la!
It does not matter if you are from ural or from poland if you just do punk for jew !
